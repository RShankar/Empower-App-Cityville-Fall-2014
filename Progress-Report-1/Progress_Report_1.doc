Project Assignment 2

(1) What will be in Processing (the part that can be customized) and what will be in Java? If you wish, identify this on the mockup screens and indicate here textually which ones will be done in which part of the App. 
	The parts of our application, CityVille, that will be in Processing for the students to be able to customize are the themes, colors, and styles. Students will be able to hard code in Processing their own themes and their own colors in the application. The application will provide a default set of themes and colors but in Processing, we will provide students a way to mix their own colors and styles to create their own themes the way they want and even provide a name for it so that it will be included in the actual app.

(2) What are the empowerment/customizability aspects that you are providing the middle school students (next summer, when I teach them Processing so they can go and customize the code)? Which member of your team is responsible for this separation? This person will also be responsible for the Processing part of the App.
	As stated before, the aspects of our application that will be customizable in Processing is allowing students implement their own colors and styles into the app itself. All members of the team have decided that the entire group will work together on Processing while also working on their own designated individual parts.
	
 (3) What assets (graphics, music, animation) are being planned for your App? List them. Who will do them in your group? If you need help from Prof. McAfee or his students, list clearly what you want. I will give them the links to Github so they can see what you are seeking. They will send them to you and you can upload them to the site. Or. they can post them at their Github site and  you can 'copy' them over. Which team member is reponsbile for this communication and build up of assets? This person also will be responsible for the UI parts built in  XML.
	The assets that are being planned for this application include logos and image designs for our application that will help our app be more presentable and also achieve a professional design. Sound effects will also be included to enhance the experience of the app. Adam Moulton will be responsible for the assets for this app.

(4) The other member (please identify here) will be responsible for the Java code. This may include sections on parse.com, Wifi, LBS, maps, Bluetooth, data analytics, etc. Some such as LBS, Wifi, and Bluetooth may also be incorporated at the Processing level.
	Alain Edwards and Lance Williams will handle the login page and the main pages of the application through Java in Eclipse. They will also handle the use of MYSQL database, the FAU lamp server, and the usage of Google maps also done in Eclipse. Adam Moulton will also be responsible for creating the Settings section of the application as well.
